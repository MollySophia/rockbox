Rules of Nim: There are 21 matches. Two players (you and the \dap{})
alternately pick a certain number of matches and the one who takes the
last match loses.  You can take up to twice as many matches as the
\dap{} selected, and vice versa.

\begin{btnmap}

\ButtonRight \opt{HAVEREMOTEKEYMAP}{& } & Increase the number of matches \\
\ButtonPlay \opt{HAVEREMOTEKEYMAP}{& } & Remove the number of matches you have selected \\
\ButtonStop \opt{HAVEREMOTEKEYMAP}{& } & Exit the game \\
\end{btnmap}
