The goal of this puzzle game is to escape a dungeon consisting of ten
``mazezams''.
These are rooms containing rows of blocks which can be shifted left or
right.
You can move the rows only by pushing them and if you move the rows
carelessly, you will get stuck.
You can have another go by selecting ``retry level'' from the menu,
but this will cost you a life.
You start the game with three lives.
Luckily, there are checkpoints at levels four and eight.
