\subsection{\label{ref:Frotz}Frotz}
Frotz is a Z-Machine interpreter for playing Infocom's interactive fiction
games, and newer games using the same format. To start a game open a
\fname{.z1} to \fname{.z8} file in the \setting{File Browser}. Most modern games
are in the \fname{.z5} or \fname{.z8} format but the older formats used by
Infocom are supported.

Z-Machine games are text based and most depend heavily on typed commands.
The virtual keyboard is used for text entry, both for typing entire lines
and for typing single characters when the game requires single character
input.

Sounds, pictures, colour and Unicode are not currently supported, but
the interpreter informs the game of this and almost all games will
adapt so that they are still playable. This port of Frotz attempts to be
compliant with the Z-Machine Specification version 1.0.

Some places where you can find Z-Machine games, and information about
