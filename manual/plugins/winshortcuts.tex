\subsection{Windows Shortcuts}
\label{ref:Winshortcutsplugin}

This plugin follows Microsoft Windows Explorer shortcuts (\fname{.lnk} files).
In Rockbox, these types of shortcuts will show up as \fname{.lnk} files. To
follow a shortcut, just ``play'' a \fname{.lnk} file from the file browser.
The plugin will navigate the file browser to the linked file (which
will be highlighted) or directory (which will be opened). Linked files will
not be automatically opened; you must do this manually.

Only relative links across the same volume are supported.

\note{You may like to use native Rockbox shortcuts instead. These can be
    created from within Rockbox itself and have advanced capabilities.
    See \reference{ref:Shortcutsplugin}.}
