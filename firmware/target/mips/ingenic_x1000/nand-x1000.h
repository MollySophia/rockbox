/* NOTE: this is a very minimal API designed only to support a bootloader.
 * Not suitable for general data storage. It doesn't have proper support for
 * partial page writes, access to spare area, etc, which are all necessary
 * for an effective flash translation layer.
 *
 * There's no ECC support. This can be added if necessary, but it's unlikely
 * the boot area on any X1000 device uses software ECC as Ingenic's SPL simply
 * doesn't have much room for more code (theirs programmed to work on multiple
 * hardware configurations, so it's bigger than ours).
