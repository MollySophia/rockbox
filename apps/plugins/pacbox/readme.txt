Pacbox is based on PIE - the Pacman Instructional Emulator written by
Alessandro Scotti.  PIE is a Pacman arcade machine emulator licensed
under the GNU GPL and is available from http://www.ascotti.org/

PIE is a Windows application written in C++ - all the Windows-specific
code was stripped out and the emulator converted to C for use in
Rockbox.

The version of PIE used as the basis of the port was v1.11
