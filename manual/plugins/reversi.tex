\subsection{Reversi}

This is a simple implementation of the Reversi game. The objective of
the game is to have a majority of own coloured pieces showing at the end
of the game. The game rules can be found in the internet.

You can choose to play manually (you place both the white and dark pieces)
or to play against a (not very smart) robot.
