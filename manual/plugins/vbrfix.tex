\subsection{VBRfix}
This function scans a VBR (Variable Bitrate)
MP3 file and updates/creates the Xing VBR header. The Xing header
contains information about the VBR stream used to calculate average bit
rate, time information and to more accurately fwd/rew in the stream.
This function is especially useful when the playback of a file skips,
fwd/rew does not work correctly or the time display is incorrect.
To use this plugin, open the \setting{Context Menu} (see \reference{ref:Contextmenu})
upon a \fname{.mp3} file and select \setting{Open With\dots $\rightarrow$ vbrfix}.

\note{
VBRfix can only run when music is turned off (since it uses
the same memory as the player) and can take a while to complete if
run on big files.}
