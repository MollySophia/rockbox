  Installing the bootloader is the trickiest part of the installation.
  We cannot distribute the bootloader directly, and thus need to patch a compatible
  version of the xDuoo firmware.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Download the Rockbox bootloader from
  \download{bootloader/xduoo/X3-v11.bsdiff}

\item Get a copy of the original \playertype{} v1.1 firmware from
  \url{httpss://www.xduoo.net/firmware-download/} and extract the .rar file to obtain the
  update image (called \fname{update.zip}).

\item Compile bspatch in rbutil/bspatch/ (run make in the dir).

\item Run
\begin{code}
    ../rbutil/bspatch/bspatch update.zip output.zip X3-v11.bsdiff
\end{code}

\item Put \fname{output.zip} in the root of the SD card and rename it to \fname{update.zip}.

\item Disconnect the player from USB and let the original firmware boot.

\item Go into the 'Setting' menu, and select 'Upgrade'. The player will reboot into Rockbox
  upon completion.

\end{enumerate}
