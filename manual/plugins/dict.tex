\subsection{Dict}

\subsubsection{Prerequisites for using the plugin}
To use the plugin, firstly you need to have the dictionary files which contain
the words (index) and their description -- \fname{dict.index} and
\fname{dict.desc}, respectively -- on \fname{/.rockbox/rocks/apps/} folder.

The dictionary files can be created by yourself, or you can get them crafted
from the web. More information can be found at \wikilink{PluginDict}.

\subsubsection{Using the plugin}
Now that you already have the two necessary files in place, you can launch the
dict plugin (under Applications on the Browse plugins menu). The first thing
you will see is the text input screen.

Type part of a word (or the whole word) or anything the dict files have a
definition to and accept the text input. The plugin will search for matching
entries on the \fname{dict.index} file and display according description/meaning
contained in the \fname{dict.desc} file.

If no matches are found on the dictionary, a ``Not found'' message will be
displayed and the plugin will exit. You can do another search by relaunching
the plugin.
