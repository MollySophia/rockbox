\begin{enumerate}
\item Compile the bootloader (this will generate a \fname{ccpmp.bin} file).

\item Get a copy of the original \playerman{} firmware (called \fname{vx777.HXF}) from
  \url{http://www.onda.cn/pro/download/biosexp.jsp?ITEM_ID=12628}.

\item Compile ChinaChipPatcher in rbutil/chinachippatcher/ (run make in the dir).

\item Run
\begin{code} 
    ../rbutil/chinachippatcher/chinachip VX747.HXF ccpmp.bin output.HXF ccpmp.old
\end{code}
    in the dir where you compiled your bootloader

\item Put \fname{output.HXF} in the root of the NAND drive (boot into the OF as
    Rockbox currently can't access the NAND storage) and name it \fname{VX777.HXF}

\item Reset your player. 

\end{enumerate}

\note{If you want to have dual-boot capabilities, copy \fname{ccpmp.old}, name it
      \fname{ccpmp.bin} to the root of your MicroSD card.}
