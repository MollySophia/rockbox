   Jz4740 USB tools

To compile usbtools, you'll need jz_xloader (which can be get at
http://repo.or.cz/w/jz_xloader.git, do
"git clone git://repo.or.cz/jz_xloader.git ." for a clone in the current dir).

When you're on Linux, just type "make linux" to compile all the utilities (make
sure you have libusb-dev installed).
For cleaning: "make clean-linux"

When you're on Windows, install MingW32 and LibUSB-Win32 and edit "Makefile" to
make sure "WIN_DRIVERS_LIBUSB_DIR" is set correctly.
For cleaning: "make clean-win"

When Windows pops up the window when it needs drivers for a "Jz4740 USB Boot
Device" (VID=601A, PID=4740), point it to the windows_driver/ directory.

On Linux there's no driver installation, everything is handled through LibUSB.

That's all!
