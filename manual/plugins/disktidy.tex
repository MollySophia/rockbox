\subsection{Disk Tidy}
  Disk Tidy deletes junk files commonly left behind by Windows, Linux and
  OS X after connecting your \dap{} over USB. Select the files you want to
  delete in the ``Files to Clean'' menu and select ``Start Cleaning'' to begin
  the process. The settings are stored in the plain text file
  \fname{.rockbox/rocks/apps/disktidy.config} that is user-modifiable to allow
  custom entries to be added.
  
  The asterisk character (``*'') can be used as a wild-card which will match any
  string; however only the first asterisk will be recognised as a wild-card 
  with any additional uses being taken as literal.\\*
  
  \warn{Be careful when you use custom entries as you could accidentally delete
        important files.}
