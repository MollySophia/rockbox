To build the theme editor, you will need a Qt development environment with the
Qt core and GUI libraries and qmake, along with standard C and C++ compilers
and libraries.  To compile, cd to the source directory and run the "qmake"
command followed by "make".  This will produce the binary "themeeditor".

The binary will launch a GUI application that will allow you to create, open,
edit and save WPS files.  Editing takes place in the central tabbed text editor.
Docks on the edges of the main window will show you a file tree, an empty
"Skin Preview," and a parse tree of the current document.  At present, only the
parse tree and the editor work correctly.  You can close all the other panels
by clicking the 'x' buttons at their corners, if you desire.  You can also
rearrange and resize panels any way you please, including tearing them off into
separate windows.

From the preferences dialog (found in the File menu, or by pressing Ctrl+P), you
can change the font and color scheme of the editor and syntax highlighter.

If you catch a bug (other than unimplemented features, which abound at this
stage) or think of a feature you'd like to see implemented, you can send me an
email at robby(at)bieberphoto(dot)com, or catch me on the #rockbox IRC channel
on Freenode.
