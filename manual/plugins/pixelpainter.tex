This game is written in LUA and based on the game of the same name by
Pavel Bakhilau (\url{http://js1k.com/2010-first/demo/453}).

Select a colour to flood-fill the board with that colour, starting from the
top-left pixel (meaning that any pixel which is connected to the top-left
through other pixels of the same colour will be changed to the selected colour).
Try to paint the entire board with as few moves as possible.
