\begin{itemize}
\item Download the Rockbox bootloader from
  \download{bootloader/gigabeat/}
\item Starting at the root directory of your player browse into the directory
  \fname{GBSYSTEM} and from that into the subdirectory \fname{FWIMG}.
  These directories are hidden. Make sure that you have configured your browser
  to show hidden files or you may be unable to see \fname{FWIMG}.
\item In that directory you'll find a file called \fname{FWIMG01.DAT}. This too
  may be hidden. Rename the file to \fname{FWIMG01.DAT.ORIG}. Make sure you
  spelled that name  correctly as it is needed for booting the \playerman{} firmware.
  \warn{If you do not complete this step then you will be unable to uninstall Rockbox
  without a copy of the original firmware from the original install CD.}
\item Now copy the file \fname{FWIMG01.DAT} you downloaded to that directory.
  Make sure the spelling is correct.
\end{itemize}
