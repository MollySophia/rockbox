    Hotkeys are shortcut keys for use in the \nopt{touchscreen}{\setting{File Browser}
    and }\setting{WPS} screen.  To use one, press 
    \nopt{touchscreen}{\ActionTreeHotkey{} within the \setting{File Browser} or}
    \ActionWpsHotkey{} within the \setting{WPS}
    screen.\nopt{touchscreen}{ The assigned function will launch with reference
    to the current file or directory, if applicable.  Each screen has its own
    assignment.} If there is no assignment for a given screen,
    the hotkey is ignored.
    
    The default assignment for the \nopt{touchscreen}{File Browser hotkey is
    \setting{Off}, while the default for the }WPS hotkey is
    \setting{View Playlist}.
    
    The hotkey assignments are changed in the Hotkey menu (see
    \reference{ref:HotkeySettings}) under \setting{General Settings}.
