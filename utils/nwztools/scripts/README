This directory contains various scripts that can be used to help development
process on the Sony NWZ players. The proper way to use it is to use the Makefile.

In case of doubt, run
  make
to get the up-to-date documentation.

*****************************
Performing a firmware upgrade
*****************************

To perform a firmware upgrade, first copy the firmware upgrade file to the root of
the device, and make sure its named
  NW_WM_FW.UPG
Another other name WILL NOT WORK. You've been warned.

DO NOT FORGET TO UNMOUNT YOUR DEVICE PROPERLY BEFORE DOING WHAT FOLLOWS

Once once, you need to tell the device to reboot in firmware upgrade mode.
At the moment, we only support this operation in UMS/MSC (Mass Storage) mode. So if
your device appears as a MTP device, go to the preference settings of your device
and make sure your device is set to UMS/MSC or Auto.
You need to identify the linux device associated with your device. There are
plenty of tutorials on the net on how to do that, you can use mount or dmesg.
Assuming the linux device corresponding to your player is
  /dev/sdx
run AS ROOT OR USING SUDO
  make do_fw_upgrade NWZ_DEV=/dev/sdx

If everything goes well, the device should reboot and perform the firmware upgrade.

********************************
Building a firmware upgrade that
dumps important stuff
********************************

In early development stage, the most useful thing you can do is to dump important
stuff from your device:
- dmesg and mount output
- FU (firmware upgrade) initrd
- root FS (file system)
We carefully wrote a script that does the following. First make sure that your device
has enough free space (at least 300MB to be safe). You need to know the model of
your device to build this firmware upgrade. Once you known it, run
  make list_targets
to list all available targets. For example if your targets is one of the
NWZ-E460 series, the corresponding target is nwz-e46x.
Once you have identified the target. Run
  make dump_rootfs NWZ_TARGET=nwz-exyz UPG=dump_rootfs.upg
(replace nwz-exyz with your target)
This command will produce a firmware upgrade file called
  dump_rootfs.upg

In order to run this firmware upgrade, you need to follows the instruction
on how to perform a firmware upgrade.

When performing the firmware upgrade, the script will perform various operation
and create several files. Once the "upgrade" is finish and the device has rebooted,
you should find the files in the dump_rootfs/ directory at the root of your device.
