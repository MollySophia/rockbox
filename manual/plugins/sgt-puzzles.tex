The games that begin with the ``sgt-'' prefix are ports of certain
puzzles from Simon Tatham's Portable Puzzle Collection, an open source
collection of single-player puzzle games.

\note{Certain puzzles may crash when run with demanding
  configurations. To prevent this, avoid setting extreme configuration
  values.}

\subsubsection{Puzzle Documentation}
For documentation on the games included, please see the ``Extensive
Help'' menu option from inside the plugin to read puzzle-specific
instructions or visit their official website at
\url{https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/}.

\subsubsection{Dynamic Font Sizing}
By default, each game will only use one of two fonts in drawing: the
hard-coded system font for fixed-width text, and the theme's UI font
for variable-width text. For improved puzzle rendering, each puzzle is
capable of using a special font pack when it is installed. This font
pack is available from
\url{https://download.rockbox.org/useful/sgt-fonts.zip}. To install,
simply extract the contents of this file to the
\fname{/.rockbox/fonts/} directory on your device. Once this has been
done, each game will dynamically load and use properly-sized fonts
whenever needed.

\note{On hard disk-based devices, this may cause a slight delay as the
  disk spins up to load the fonts when a puzzle is first started, and
  after using the ``Extensive Help'' feature.}

\subsubsection{``Zoom In'' Feature}
The ``Zoom In'' feature is available as an option from the pause
menu. It has two modes: viewing mode, and interaction mode. The
current mode is indicated in the title bar at the bottom of the
screen. This feature is most useful with low-resolution devices and
large puzzles.

Viewing mode is entered when the ``Zoom In'' option is selected, or
when {\PluginCancel} is pressed in interaction mode. It allows you to
pan around an enlarged version of the game. The directional keys pan
the image by a small amount in their respective directions, and
{\PluginSelect} should toggle interaction mode. To return to the pause
menu from viewing mode, press {\PluginCancel}.

In interaction mode, activated from viewer mode by pressing
{\PluginSelect}, your device's buttons all function as they do in the
normal gameplay mode, with the exception of {\PluginCancel}, which
returns the game to viewing mode, whereas in the normal gameplay mode
it would return directly to the pause menu. To return to the pause
menu from interaction mode, press {\PluginCancel} twice.

\note{Using certain features such as the ``Zoom In'' option may stop
  audio playback. This is normal, as the game requires additional
  memory from the system, which will automatically stop playback. The
  ``Playback Control'' menu will be hidden whenever this
  happens. Exiting the game will allow the resumption of audio
  playback.}
