This plugin is for demo purposes only. It is planned to have 
Wavplay as part of the normal playback engine later.

At the moment it is only possible to start playing one \fname{.wav}-file at a 
time. Therefore playlists are impossible. As every other viewer plugin, Wavplay
is associated with the specific files. Playing a \fname{.wav}-file starts the 
plugin automatically and the Wavplay screen 
appears. This screen gives information about sample rate and length of the 
playing file. 
\note{Seeking within the \fname{.wav}-file or changing the volume once the 
plugin is running is not possible. Wavplay uses the sound settings that were 
used before (except for pitch).}
The only action that can be performed is to stop by pressing \ButtonOff, and 
Wavplay will be exited and you are returned to the  file browser. If the end of 
the file has been reached, you will also be returned to the file browser.
