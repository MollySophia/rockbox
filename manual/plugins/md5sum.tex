\subsection{md5sum}
Open a file, a directory or just launch it from the plugin menu to create
an md5sum of the file, the directory's contents or the whole filesystem.
 If the file's extension is \fname{.md5} or \fname{.md5sum}, it will check 
 the md5 sums in the file instead. If the file's extension is .md5list it 
 will compute md5 sums for all the files listed.
