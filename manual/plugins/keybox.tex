\subsection{Keybox}
Keybox is an encrypted password storage using the ``Tiny Encryption Algorithm''
with a key derived using md5.

\subsubsection{Using Keybox}
To get started, start up the plugin and select \setting{Enter Keybox}.
The first time you enter Keybox you will be prompted for a master password
and for confirmation of the master password. The master password is the
password that you must use to access your stored passwords.

Once inside, enter the context menu by pressing \ActionStdContext.
From the context menu you can create new entries, delete entries and edit entries.
Each entry has a ``title'', a ``user name'' and a ``password''.

Selecting \setting{Reset Keybox} from the main menu will delete the current
list of passwords and a new, empty list will be created the next time you
select \setting{Enter Keybox} after prompting for a new master password.
Entries are automatically saved when the plugin is exited.
