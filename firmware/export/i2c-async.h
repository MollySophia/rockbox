/* i2c-async provides an API for asynchronous communication over an I2C bus.
 * It's not linked to a specific target, so device drivers using this API can
 * be shared more easily among multiple targets.
 *
 * Transactions are built using descriptors, and callbacks can be used to
 * perform work directly from interrupt context. Callbacks can even change
 * the descriptor chain on the fly, so the transaction can be altered based
 * on data recieved over the I2C bus.
 *
 * There's an API for synchronous operations on devices using 8-bit register
 * addresses. This API demonstrates how you can build more specialized routines
 * on top of the asynchronous API, and is useful in its own right for dealing
 * with simple devices.

/* Descriptors are used to set up an I2C transfer. The transfer mode is
 * specified by 'tran_mode', and is normally a READ or WRITE operation.
 * The transfer mode dictates how the buffer/count fields are interpreted.
 *
 * - I2C_WRITE
 *      buffer[0] must be non-NULL and count[0] must be at least 1.
 *      The transfer sends count[0] bytes from buffer[0] on the bus.
 *
 *      buffer[1] and count[1] can be used to specify a second buffer
 *      whose contents are written after the buffer[0]'s last byte.
 *      No start/stop conditions are issued between the buffers; it is
 *      as if you had appended the contents of buffer[1] to buffer[0].
 *
 *      If not used, buffer[1] must be NULL and count[1] must be 0.
 *      If used, buffer[1] must be non-NULL and count[1] must be >= 1.
 *
 * - I2C_READ
 *      buffer[1] must be non-NULL and count[1] must be at least 1.
 *      The transfer will request count[1] bytes and writes the data
 *      into buffer[1].
 *
 *      This type of transfer can send some data bytes before the
 *      read operation, eg. to send a register address for the read.
 *      If this feature is not used, set buffer[0] to NULL and set
 *      count[0] to zero.
 *
 *      If used, buffer[0] must be non-NULL and count[0] must be >= 1.
 *      Between the last byte written and the first byte read, the bus
 *      will automatically issue a RESTART condition.
 *
 * Bus conditions are divided into two classes: start and end conditions.
 * You MUST supply both a start and end condition in the 'bus_cond' field,
 * by OR'ing together one start condition and one end condition:
 *
 * - I2C_START
 *      Issue a START condition before the first data byte. This must be
 *      specified on the first descriptor of a transaction.
 *
 * - I2C_RESTART
 *      Issue a RESTART condition before the first data byte. On the bus this
 *      is physically identical to a START condition, but drivers might need
 *      this to distinguish between these two cases.
 *
 * - I2C_CONTINUE
 *      Do not issue any condition before the first data byte. This is only
 *      valid if the descriptor continues a previous descriptor which ended
 *      with the HOLD condition; otherwise the results are undefined.
 *
 * - I2C_STOP
 *      Issue a STOP condition after the last data byte. This must be set on
 *      the final descriptor in a transaction, so the bus is left in a usable
 *      state when the descriptor finishes.
 *
 * - I2C_HOLD
 *      Do not issue any condition after the last data byte. This is only
 *      valid if the next descriptor starts with an I2C_CONTINUE condition.

/* Aysnchronously enqueue a descriptor, optionally waiting on a timeout
 * if the queue is full. The exact behavior depends on 'q_mode':
 *
 * - I2C_Q_ADD
 *      Always try to enqueue the descriptor.
 *
 * - I2C_Q_ONCE
 *      Only attempt to enqueue the descriptor if no descriptor with the same
 *      cookie is already running or queued. If this is not the case, then
 *      returns I2C_RC_NOTADDED.
 *
 * - I2C_Q_REPLACE
 *      If a descriptor with the same cookie is queued, replace it with this
 *      descriptor and do not run the old descriptor's callbacks. If the
 *      matching descriptor is running, returns I2C_RC_NOTADDED and does not
 *      queue the new descriptor. If no match was found, then simply add the
 *      new descriptor to the queue.
 *
 * The 'cookie' is only useful if you want to use the ONCE or REPLACE queue
 * modes, or if you want to use i2c_async_cancel(). Cookies used for queue
 * management must be reserved with i2c_async_reserve_cookies(), to prevent
 * different drivers from stepping on each other's toes.
 *
 * When you do not need queue management, you can use a 'cookie' of 0, which
 * is reserved for unmanaged transactions. Only use I2C_Q_ADD if you do this.
 *
 * Queuing is only successful if I2C_RC_OK is returned. All other codes
 * indicate that the descriptor was not queued, and therefore will not be
 * executed.
 *
 * Be careful about how/when you modify and queue descriptors. It's unsafe to
 * modify a queued descriptor: it could start running at any time, and the bus
 * might see a half-rewritten version of the descriptor. You _can_ queue the
 * same descriptor twice, since the i2c-async driver is not allowed to modify
 * any fields, but your callbacks need to be written with this case in mind.
 *
 * You can use queue management to help efficiently re-use descriptors.
 * Typically you can alternate between multiple descriptors, always keeping one
 * free to modify, and using your completion callbacks to cycle the free slot.
 * You can also probe with i2c_async_cancel() to ensure a specific descriptor
 * is not running before modifying it.
