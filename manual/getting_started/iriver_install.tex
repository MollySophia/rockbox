  Installing the bootloader is the trickiest part of the installation.
  As explained above, we cannot distribute the bootloader directly, and
  thus need to patch a compatible version of the Iriver firmware, which
  can be downloaded as described above.


\begin{enumerate}
  \item Download the firmware patcher \fname{fwpatcher.exe} from 
  \download{bootloader/iriver/} and save it to your desktop.
    \note{The firmware patcher contains Unicode support, which is not supported by 
    all versions of Windows. If you have difficulty with the firmware patcher, try 
    downloading the alternate firmware patcher \fname{fwpatchernu.exe}, which is 
    built without Unicode support.}
  %
  \item Go to your desktop and double-click on the firmware patcher.
  %
  \item In the firmware patcher dialog box, click on the \setting{Browse}
  button and navigate
  to the \fname{.hex} file that you previously downloaded.
  %
  \item Click \setting{Patch}. The firmware patcher will patch the
    original firmware to include the Rockbox bootloader. The \fname{.hex}
    file on your desktop is now a modified version of the original
    \fname{.hex} file.
  %
  \item Copy \fname{.hex} to the root folder (the highest level) of your \dap{}
\end{enumerate}
