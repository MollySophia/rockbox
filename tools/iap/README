These are perl test scripts for validating the IAP implementation.
Also included is a perl class for talking to an iPod via the serial
port. You will probably need Linux to use this.

Run "make moduletest" to test the perl module itself. This will not
require any serial connection, or even an iPod, for that matter.

Run "make test" to run the iPod communication tests themselves.

In order to test make sure

- the iPod is connected to a serial port
- the test scripts assume that this port is /dev/ttyUSB0. Change
  as neccessary

Sometimes, tests will time out instead of giving the desired result.
As long as the timeouts are not reproducable this is usually not a
problem. The serial port is known to be unreliable, and devices will
retransmit. This happens even with the OF.

The tests were designed against an iPod Touch 2G as a reference device.
Some older iPods fail some of the test, even with the OF, because of
behaviour changes in later firmware releases by Apple.
