\subsection{PDBox}

PDBox is a Pure Data audio environment with small-size GUI. Those who do not know
what Pure Data is are advised to look at the book \href{http://aspress.co.uk/ds/}
{``Designing Sound''}, both at the abridged text and at the sample chapters.
Another good Pure Data tutorial can be found at \url{http://www.pd-tutorial.com/}.
