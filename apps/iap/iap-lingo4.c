             * SelectDBRecord command. Ignoring errors may cause unexpected
             * behavior.
             * To undo a database selection, send the SelectDBRecord telegram
             * with the current category selected in theDatabase Engine and a

             * pressing the iPod Menu button once and moves the database
             * selection up to the next highest menu level. For example, if a
             * device selected artist number three and then album number one,
             * it could use the SelectDBRecord(Album, -1) telegram to return
             * to the database selection of artist number three. If multiple
             * database selections have been made, devices can use any of the
             * previously used categories to return to the next highest database
             * selection. If the category used in one of these SelectDBRecord
             * telegrams has not been used in a previous database selection
             * then the command is treated as a no-op.
             * Sending a SelectDBRecord telegram with the Track category and a
             * record index of -1 is invalid, because the previous database
             * selection made with the Track category and a valid index passes
             * the database selection to the Playback Engine.
             * Sending a SelectDBRecord(Track, -1) telegram returns a parameter
             * error. The iPod also returns a bad parameter error ACK when
             * devices send the SelectDBRecord telegram with an invalid category
             * type, or with the Track category and an index greater than the

             * Shuffling tracks does not affect the track index, just the track

             * shuffled, a new track is placed into index 1. The playback
             * indexes themselves are not shuffled.
             * When shuffle mode is enabled, tracks that are marked 'skip when
             * shuffling' are filtered from the database selection. This affects
             * all audiobooks and all tracks that the user has marked in iTunes.
             * It also affects all podcasts unless their default 'skip when

             * to the iPod.
             *
             * Note: The SetDisplayImage telegram payload length is limited to
             * 500 bytes. This telegram length limit and the size and format of
             * the display image generally determine the minimum number of
             * telegrams that are required to set a display image.
             *
             * Note: Starting with the second generation iPod nano with version
             * 1.1.2 firmware, the use of the SetDisplayImage command is
             * limited to once every 15 seconds over USB transport. The iPod
             * classic and iPod 3G nano apply this restriction to both USB and
             * UART transports. Calls made to SetDisplayImage more frequently
             * than every 15 seconds will return a successful ACK command, but
             * the bitmap will not be displayed on the iPods screen. Hence use
