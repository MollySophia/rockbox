sansapatcher
------------

To compile sansapatcher, you need both the C200 and E200 Rockbox
bootloaders.  The latest bootloaders can always be found here:

http://download.rockbox.org/bootloader/sandisk-sansa/e200/PP5022.mi4
http://download.rockbox.org/bootloader/sandisk-sansa/c200/firmware.mi4

Place both these files in the sansapatcher source directory, and type "make".


Building your own bootloaders
-----------------------------

If you would like to compile the bootloaders yourself, they are the output of
running the "Bootloader" build for the E200 and C200 targets.

NOTE: Unless you know what you are doing, it is recommended that you
      use the official pre-built binary bootloaders linked to above.
      Bootloaders compiled from current Rockbox SVN are untested and
      may contain bugs preventing you from starting the device (or
      worse...).

In the Rockbox source directory, do:

mkdir build-e200-bootloader
cd build-e200-bootloader
../tools/configure
[Select E200, then B for bootloader]
make

This will create PP5022.mi4 which you should copy to the sansapatcher
build directory.

A similar process for the C200 will create firmware.mi4.
