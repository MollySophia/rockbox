\subsection{Search}
This plugin can be used on playlists.  It searches through the playlist
that it opened on looking for any occurrences of the string entered by the
user.  The results of this search are saved to a new playlist,
\textbf{search\_results.m3u}, within the same directory as the
original playlist.
