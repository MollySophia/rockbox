26.09.2006 do not update border when we don't see it. some more cleanup.

25.09.2006 yet more code cleanup, quick snapshot feature,sound should no longer crash,light optimizations

04.09.2006 code cleanup; now using IRAM correctly (i hope)

31.08.2006 far better sound, volume option is working now

29.08.2006 predefined keymaps, menu reworking, volume settings

28.08.2006 more options : frame-skipping, sound on/off, toggle 'fast' mode
28.08.2006 output actual speed of emulation in percent rather than number of rendered frames
28.08.2006 timing implementation (no >100 % speed in sims)


15.08.2006 output FPS on screen when in buffered and into logf when in unbuffered mode (grayscale)


15.08.2006 buffered mode when in grayscale mode

11.08.2006 support for grayscale lib

98/05/18  Version 0.94 released
===============================

98/05/18  Updated the man page (a more complete man-page is still needed!)
98/05/15  Some bugs fixed

98/05/14 Version 0.93.4 released
--------------------------------

98/05/14  Small additions:
      - Keyboard matrix is emulated (only 1 level, I hope this is enough) 
          - "color refreshing" (maybe some other aplications could do it!)
          - Keyboard configuration is now fully implemented
    
98/05/11  Added DOS timer support with Allegro library

98/05/08  Version 0.93.3 released
---------------------------------
    
98/05/08  Created README.Z80 to describe how to use Z80 emulation    
98/05/06  Small new features + bugfixes
      - Function keys for commonly used functions
      - Keyboard config: (extended, spectrum, compat) and (shifted, raw) 
        are now working. No custom keyboard or joystick yet
      - Small modifications to make z80 emulation separate

98/04/30  Version 0.93.2 released
---------------------------------

98/04/30  I've removed the BROKEN_VGAKEYBOARD part from vgakey.c. 
      I hope nobody's using SVGALIB version smaller than 1.2.11.

98/04/29  Some small new features: (see example.cfg for a complete list)
      - different icon when the emulator is paused
      - optional private colormap
      - configurable colours (grayscale looks better on
        monochrome displays)
      - filetype can be given on the command line (tapefiles too)
      - optional immediate loading of tapes (-load-immed)
    
98/04/27  Added configurability to spectemu:
      - global config file (($prefix)/share/spectemu/spectemu.cfg)
      - user's config file (~/.spectemurc)
      - X resource database
      - command line
    
98/04/23  Mode 320x240 is used in vgaspect (if available)

98/04/22  Version 0.93.1 released
---------------------------------
    
98/04/21  Handle "extra" ascii keys: []{}|\~
98/04/19  Added Spectrum keyboard picture, which shows pressed keys, and
      keys can be pressed with mouse.
98/04/16  Rewrite keyboard handling:
      - Fixes keyboard bug in X (key remained pressed)
      - Better configurability: spectrum key definitions are in spkey.c
        instead of xkey.c and vgakey.c

98/04/07  Added readline support by Christian Sievers <sievers@cip.rz.tu-bs.de>

98/03/24  Version 0.92 released
===============================
    
98/03/23  Last minute bugfixes
    
98/03/20  Version 0.92p3 released
98/03/20  Eliminated all sorts of minor bugs
98/03/19  Implement LOOP/CALL/RETURN blocks in TZX handling
98/03/17  Fixed (hopefully all) bugs in TZX handling:
       - There must be a 1ms pause at end of tape.
      - Pausing after data blocks fixed.
      - Made tape I/O timing ultra precise (e.g. see Flashpoint)
    
98/03/14  Fixed small bug in quick load
98/03/13  Sound of tape is now fixed (not perfect, but good enough)
          Created simple man page
    
98/03/11  Version 0.92pre2 released
98/03/10  Fixed quick load of tapefiles
98/03/10  Fixed resize bugs

98/03/09  Version 0.92pre1 released
98/03/08  C-version now handles bits 3 and 5 of the Flag register
      (I hope I didn't break anything with this).
98/03/08  Wrote 'tapeout' utility to save tapefiles to real tape (via 
      soundcard).

98/03/06  Implemented emulator pause.
98/03/06  Added ability to display spectrum keyboard layout on text 
      console (Radovan.Garabik@fmph.uniba.sk).

98/03/05  Rewrite of snapshot handeling:
          - All versions of Z80 snapshots can now be loaded.
      - Loading and saving of SNA snapshot format is supported. 
      - Quick loading and saving of temporary snapshot.
    
98/03/03  Rewrite of tapefile handeling:
      - Support for most TZX blocks (recognise length of all v1.11
        blocks)
      - SPT tapefiles are no longer supported 
          - Added quick loading of tapefiles
      - Timing in tape emulation is very exact now, but this makes 
        tape sound ugly (this will be fixed).
