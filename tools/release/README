 This directory contains useful scripts when creating and building
 releases. The plan is to hopefully create a single top-level script that will
 run everything needed to make a complete and full release and put all
 generated data into a separate output directory.

 NOTE that these scripts assume that you have the necessary compilers already
 present in your PATH.

 The scripts:

 bins.pl          Builds all the binary rockbox zip files.

 manuals.pl       Builds all manuals

 voices.pl        Builds all english voice files

 tarball.sh       Builds the source tarball


 STATUS

 All these scripts have a "version" variable at the top that needs editing and
 each of this script needs to be run at the source tree root to function. Most
 of them put their generated files in a subdir called 'output' which the
 scripts create.
