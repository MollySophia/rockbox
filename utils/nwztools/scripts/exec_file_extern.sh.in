# The updater script on the NWZ has a major bug/feature:
# it does NOT clear the update flag if the update scrit fails
# thus causing a update/reboot loop and a bricked device
# always clear to make sure we don't end up being screwed

#
# This script remounts the user (aka contents) partition read-write-exec and
# runs the file given and redirects its output and error to a file.
# To use this file, you need to replace NWZ_EXEC_THIS by the file you want to
# execute and NWZ_LOG_THIS by the name of the file you want to log to. You may
# use sed as follows for this purpose:
# cat exec_file_extern.sh.in | sed 's|NWZ_EXEC_THIS|myfile.elf|' | \
#                              sed 's|NWZ_LOG_THIS|exec.log|' > my_exec_file.sh
#
# NOTE 1: technically, NWZ_EXEC_THIS can be any command, not just a file
# NOTE 2: this script will export the variable NWZ_CONTENTS that is the path to
#         the user partition, so that if NWZ_EXEC_THIS is a bash script, it can
#         easily use it
#

# go to /tmp
cd /tmp

# get content partition path
CONTENTS="/contents"
