This directory contains the checkwps tool which can be used to
validate wps files outside of Rockbox.

checkwps uses the Rockbox WPS parser and is therefore built in
target-specific versions (to avoid making lots of changes to the core
code).

To compile
----------

Just run the ./buildall.sh script


To remove all compiled files
----------------------------

./cleanall.sh


To add a new target
-------------------

Add $target and $modelname from tools/configure to targets.txt
