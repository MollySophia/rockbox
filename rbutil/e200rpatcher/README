INTRODUCTION

e200rpatcher is a tool for uploading and executing an application to
an E200R in manufacturing mode.  It is intended to be used to upload
the patching application to allow Rockbox installs.

e200rpatcher requires libusb (v0.1.2 has been tested successfully) for
cross-platform USB access.  No-one has yet successfully installed
e200rpatcher on Windows, but it works on Linux and Mac OS X (and
should be fine on other Unix-like systems that libusb supports).

GENERAL BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

A pre-requisite for compiling e200rpatcher is a file called
"bootloader.bin" - this is the output of running an "I" (installer)
build for the E200R target.

In the Rockbox source directory, do:

mkdir build-e200rbootbin
cd build-e200rbootbin
../tools/configure
[Select E200R, then I for installer]
make

This should give you a bootloader/bootloader/bin file which you should
copy to the e200rpatcher source directory.

BUILDING ON LINUX

The Makefile expects libusb (and the headers) to be installed on your
system and will link dynamically.  Just type "make".

BUILDING ON A MAC

To build the mac version (target e200rpatcher-mac in the Makefile)
requires three files from libusb to be copied to the current
directory:

usb.h (copied from your libusb build directory)
libusb-i386.a (copied and renamed from .libs/libusb.a in an i386 build)
libusb-ppc.a (copied and renamed from .libs/libusb.a in a PPC build)

To build the required libusb.a files, just run ./configure && make for
libusb.  If anyone knows how to cross-compile a static libusb.a please
make the information known - this is currently done by compiling
natively on the appropriate hardware.
